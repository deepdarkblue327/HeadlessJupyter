# HeadlessJupyter
VB Script to open a jupyter notebook without the annoying command prompt running.
Just clone or download the host.vbs file and double click to open jupyter notebook. 
Note: The script assumes you have python and ipython installed in c:/Python27. Just open the script and change the directory if you have it in a different location.
